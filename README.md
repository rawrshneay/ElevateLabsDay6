Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
Aim for 12 or more characters in length
Avoid dictionary words, names, or predictable patterns (like 123, birth years)
Randomize character placement rather than using structured patterns
Use password managers to generate and store strong, unique passwords

Tips Learned from the Evaluation:

password123 was rated very weak – common and easily guessable

roshni11 was weak – includes a name and predictable numbers

Sun!set@89 was moderate to good – uses special characters and some complexity

Z$g7tL#vQ9! was strong – random, includes all character types

T!mE$@987x#LrQp was very strong – long, randomized, and highly secure

Key Lessons:
Avoid personal information (like your name)
Increase randomness and character diversity
Make passwords longer for exponential security gain
Password strength increases non-linearly with complexity

Common Password Attacks (Research Summary):
Brute Force Attack:
Tries all possible combinations
Short/simple passwords get cracked within seconds to minutes
Complexity and length slow down brute-force dramatically

Dictionary Attack:
Uses a list of common passwords or words (like password, roshni)
Easily cracks passwords based on real names, words, or phrases

Credential Stuffing:
Reuses leaked username-password pairs from breaches
Repeating passwords across sites increases vulnerability
Protection Against Attacks:
Use unique, strong passwords for each account

Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Change passwords regularly

How Password Complexity Affects Security
Password complexity is a critical factor in defending against cyberattacks. Simple passwords like password123 or names like roshni11 are highly vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks, often cracked in under a second. As complexity increases—with the use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and longer lengths—the time and effort required to crack the password grow exponentially, often becoming computationally infeasible.

Hence, complex passwords significantly enhance security, especially when paired with best practices like password managers and 2FA.
